# Credit-Card-Launch-Analysis
Analyzed customer, credit, and transaction data to evaluate the impact of a credit card launch. Identified spending trends and high-value customer segments using Python and SQL. Built insights to power an interactive Streamlit dashboard for business decision-making.

This project analyzes customer behavior, transactions, and credit profiles to evaluate the impact of a **credit card product launch / marketing campaign**.  
The final goal is to **design an interactive Streamlit dashboard** that provides business stakeholders with actionable insights into customer engagement, spending patterns, and campaign performance.
